Supplementary Data 5. List of S-Chimeras from Hfq::3xFLAG libraries at three growth stages (>=10 chimeric reads)

RNA1 name: Common name of RNA1 mapped to the genomic 
RNA2 name: Common name of RNA2 mapped to the genomic 
RNA1 Strand: The strand RNA1 was mapped to
RNA1 from: Position of the first nucleotide of the most 5' chimera mapped to RNA1.
RNA1 to: Position of the first nucleotide of the most 3' chimera mapped to RNA1.
RNA1 ligation from: Position of the last nucleotide of the most 5' chimera mapped to RNA1.
RNA1 ligation to: Position of the last nucleotide of the most 3' chimera mapped to RNA1.
RNA2 Strand: The strand RNA2 was mapped to
RNA2 from: Position of the last nucleotide of the most 5' chimera mapped to RNA2.
RNA2 to: Position of the last nucleotide of the most 3' chimera mapped to RNA2.
RNA2 ligation from: Position of the first nucleotide of the most 5' chimera mapped to RNA2.
RNA2 ligation to: Position of the first nucleotide of the most 3' chimera mapped to RNA2.
Number of interactions: Number of chimeras supporting the interaction.
"Odds Ratio: (K/L)/(M/N), where K= Number of chimeric fragments of RNA1-RNA2, L=number of other fragments involving  RNA2, M=number of other fragments involving  RNA1, N=number of all other  fragments (that do not involve RNA1 and RNA2)."
One-sided Fisher's exact test p-value: p-value for observing at least this number of chimeric fragments given their background frequencies on Hfq. The Odds Ratio provides the effect size of the test.
RNA1 type: The genomic annotation of RNA1
RNA2 type: The genomic annotation of RNA2
"RNA1 seq: RNA1 start was taken from the coordinate termed ""RNA1 from"" and RNA1 end was taken the coordinate termed ""RNA1 ligation to"". If  ""RNA1 ligation to"" was not identified, RNA1 end was taken 20 nucleotides downstream the coordinate termed ""RNA1 to""."
"RNA2 seq: RNA2 start was taken  the coordinate termed ""RNA2  ligation  from"" and the end was taken at coordinate of ""RNA2 to"". If  ""RNA2 ligation from"" was not identified, RNA2 start was taken 20 nucleotides upstream the coordinate termed ""RNA2 from"""
